 RabbitMQ is a message-queueing software. It means it provides us the platform which helps us to send and receive messages. A message can include any kind of information like a simple text message, and etc.  
There are two endpoints, the one is Publisher and the second one is the Consumer. So, the publisher will publish the message to the message broker service. And the RabbitMQ server will store the message in a queue. Now, multiple consumers can subscribe to this queue. And then all Consumers will receive the message whenever they are available. So, using message-broker you will never lose your data.
